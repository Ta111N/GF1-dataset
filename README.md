Dataset information on the paper "Cloud and Cloud Shadow Detection of GF-1 Images Based on the Swin-UNet Method".  
## Overview  
In this study, GF-1 WFV multispectral images were selected. Specifically, this paper will use the publicly available GF1_WHU cloud and cloud shadow detection datasets(published by Wuhan University,http://sendimage.whu.edu.cn/en/mfc-validation-data/) for related research. GF-1, the inaugural satellite of the civilian High-Definition Earth Observation Satellite (HDEOS) program, achieved successful launch aboard the Long March 2 carrier rocket on April 26, 2013. The GF-1 is equipped with the WFV camera, capable of capturing multispectral images at a spatial resolution of 16 meters. It comprises four spectral bands: blue (0.45-0.52 µm), green (0.52-0.59 µm), red (0.63-0.69 µm), and near-infrared (NIR) (0.77-0.89 µm). Furthermore, the satellite features four WFV sensors that concurrently cover a swath width of up to 800 kilometers. Impressively, it offers a revisit period of merely 4 days, facilitating large-scale, short-term surface observation, and monitoring capabilities.  
Specifically, the global distribution of the dataset is as follows：
